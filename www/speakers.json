In this session, I'll cover what inspired me to take the path of self directed learning and what challenges I faced along the way. The first websites I made were simple and only used a tiny bit of html and css. By the end I was making dynamic, interactive apps. In this talk I'll present a selection of some of my favorite websites from the project which include games, toys, physics simulations, data visualizations and real time communication apps."

Instead of providing many framework features, React is trying to utilize patterns, paradigms and JavaScript language features to accomplish the same tasks that other frameworks have dedicated APIs for. Not all environments have these natively. We need to polyfill new an experimental features. How can we safely do that? Is it better to have a non-standard library?"

It has dumped the ʺAbove the Foldʺ idea that people don't scroll by simply encouraging users to do so by entertaining them with movement and a sensation of depth. In this talk, we will go through real-time examples of Parallax animations, its anchors and its performance."

However with the rise of single page apps (SPAs), user interfaces are being rendered in the browser using JavaScript. In this talk we'll be introducing FormatJS: a collection of JavaScript libraries for internationalization that are focused on formatting numbers, dates, and strings. We'll do a walkthrough of JavaScript's Intl API and some of the core libraries we've developed, as well as a set of integrations for Handlebars, Dust and React. Finally, we'll discuss how these tools can be useful even if your application is only written in one language."

Combining web standards, storytelling, data analysis and advanced graphics techniques we aim to translate into images the way people around the world have reacted on Twitter to an event. For our visualizations the Web is the best delivery platform and we use all graphics standards: 2D Canvas, WebGL, SVG and HTML based on the requirements of each visualization and accounting for factors like: number of elements in the screen, shape complexity, interaction, mobile support, libraries available and more. Through the exposition of some of our work, we will describe the workflow we use to create interactive public-facing visualizations at Twitter. We will go through a pipeline which includes stages of research of novel visualization techniques, design and planning for an event, data gathering and processing, prototyping and publishing visualizations."

JavaScript is everywhere, and with the advent of Internet of Things, Big Data, robotics and drones, and distributed computing, there are more applications that applies artificial intelligence ideas."

Unfortunately, it's kind of bland (on purpose!), and all the sites on the internet are starting to look the same. At Stripe, we wanted the same power of being able to spin up projects quickly, but without using Bootstrap, specifically. So we made \"Bootstripe\". It's able to be much more opinionated, and allows lots of parallel developers to build consistent user interfaces. I'd love to tell you how to build your own, how to test it, and how to integrate it into your applications."

Besides the cool things you can build in NodeBots the most awesome part of it is the community, you'll see what we are doing from the community point of view and how we are achieving social impact bringing more people from all ages to programming and electronics, specially in Latin america, through the NodeBots community."

The data is produced by applications using different technology stacks and comes from various sources, from web servers to sensors. How could you solve this problem? Enter RabbitMQ. In this talk we are going to show how to build a system that can ingest data produced at separate geo located areas (think AWS and it's many regions) and replicate it to a central cluster where it can be further processed and analysed. We will present an example of how to build a system like this one by using RabbitMQ Federation to replicate data across AWS Regions and RabbitMQ support for many protocols to produce/consume data. To help with scalability we are going to show an interesting way to implement sharded queues with RabbitMQ by using the Consistent Hash Exchange. If you want to learn what else has RabbitMQ to offer beyond simple messaging and queueing, then this is the talk for you."

You will learn how we are using modern container technologies based on CoreOS and Docker to enable customers to run custom Node.js and C# code (via Edge.js) in a way that is safe, fair, and fast."
